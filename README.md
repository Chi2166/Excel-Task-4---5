# Excel-Task-4-5

# Introduction
This task is geared toward creating pivot tables and visualizing insights derived from the analysis using the Medical students’ data. 
# Problem Statement
## This dataset will answer 5 basic questions.
-	Average value for the following for males and females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heat rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol).
-	Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places).
-	Number of students across the different Blood groups.
-	Number of students who smoke and who don’t.
-	Number of Students who have diabetes and who don’t.

The above pivot table and chart show the Average values of both male and female students in terms of  Age, BMI, temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol. 
-	For both Genders, average Values for Age are Males = 26.05995553 and Females = 26.00587473.
-	The average BMI for Males and Females are 23.3267048 and 23.34842037 respectively. Which made it the lowest value recorded from the analysis. 
-	The average values from temperature are Males = 98.6002124 and Females = 98.60114373.
-	The average values of heart rate in Males = 79. 42975757 and Females = 79.56277356.
-	The average value of blood pressure in Males = 114.5285124 and Females = 114.6435872. 
-	The average value of cholesterol in Males = 184.5605868 and Females = 184.5043228. making the highest value recorded.
## The above analysis indicates that all values for age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol have little differences.

-	The above analysis shows the Average height and weight of both male and female students.    
-	The weight of male students is 69.76 and height is 174.97.
-	The weight of female students is 69.97 and height is 174.92. 
### Without indicating much difference for both genders in Weight and height.

## The analysis explains the amount of students with each specific blood group.
-	39970 students have blood group A
-	40071 students have blood group AB
-	40945 students have blood group B
-	40977 students have blood group C

- The chart above shows the students who smoke and those who don’t smoke. Students who smoke are 32416 and those who don’t smoke are 129572.

- The chart above shows the students who smoke and those who don’t smoke. Students who have diabetes are 32416 and those who don’t have diabetes are 145867.
 
## Conclusion
The analysis conducted shows pivot tables and visuals in sighting average values of students’ age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, and blood group, calculating the average weight and height of both genders and highlighting the numbers of students across each blood group. Giving an account of students with diabetes and students without diabetes. Finally, it analyzed the students who smoke and students who don’t smoke. This insight can be used to determine outcomes in educational settings.
